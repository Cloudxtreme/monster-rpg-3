At Nooskewl, we believe if you buy a game (or any piece of software), you should
not be restricted in how you can use it. Digital goods are unique though,
because you can make copies and it costs you nothing. While sharing is great, if
someone's job (what they spend most of their time doing) is making games, they
deserve (and NEED) to be compensated. The license for this game is what we
believe is the best balance between your rights and freedoms and ours. You can
do almost anything you want with the game. You can even give family members
copies. But you can't give copies to anyone outside your family. This allows us
to sell the game and make money for our hard work, and frees you from the
hassles of restrictive licenses.

We allow you to make derivatives and distribute those as long as they bear no
resemblance to and don't use too similar a name as the original. This mainly
applies to the source code, which we provide for everyone who has a license for
the game. The source code is also available freely for educational purposes. We
just ask that you do not distribute copies and that if you're downloading and
building it to play the game, you purchase a license.

We believe this is the best compromise for everyone involved. It allows us to
earn money which allows us to build high quality games, and gives you near 100%
freedom. So enjoy the ability to install on as many devices as you want, give
your family free copies and always have the code in case the game doesn't work
on the computers of the future. It's what we want for ourselves, so it's what
we're giving to you if you buy a license.

Summary:

* You can access the code freely for educational purposes
* You can make copies of the source and binaries for yourself and your family
  and install on any number of devices if you buy a license
* You can make derivatives of the game and distribute them if you have a
  paid license
* You can never distribute copies of source or binaries outside of your family
* Your derivatives cannot bear a close resemblance to or have a similar name
  as the original, such as using the same art assets
* If you're downloading the source to build it and play it, you need to buy
  a license
